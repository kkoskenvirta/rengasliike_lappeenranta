This file is a placeholder for the theme screenshot.

To complete the theme, you need to:

1. Create a screenshot.png file (1200x900 pixels) showing your theme's homepage
2. Replace this .txt file with the actual screenshot.png

The screenshot should showcase:
- Hero section with branding
- Services grid
- Contact information
- Overall design aesthetic

This screenshot will appear in the WordPress admin when selecting themes.
